# AI-detection browser extension

A very basic project aiming to make a simple browser extension that detects common AI-giveaways such as em-dashes. We all have that one youtube channel we can't prove uses AI but we just know does. Here it is, for petty people like myself.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Create functioning prototype
- [ ] Deploy on chrome store.
